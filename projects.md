## Statistical Analysis

#### Voting Difficulty in the 2020 US Elections
**Purpose**
- Did Democratic voters or Republican voters report experiencing more difficulty voting in the 2020 election?
- The null hypothesis was that Democrats and Republicans reported an equal amount of difficulty in voting in
the 2020 election. Stated more formally, if we think about level of difficulty for Republicans as the variable X
and difficulty for Democrats as variable Y, then the null hypothesis would be that P(X<Y) = P(X>Y).

**Statistical Test/Technology**
  - Wilcoxon Rank-Sum Test
  - R Programming
