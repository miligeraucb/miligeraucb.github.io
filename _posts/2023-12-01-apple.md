## Purpose
- Early detection of disease in apple orchards can positively impact the US apple industry which suffers millions of dollars in loss due to various disease states. 
  
## Technique (Models),Technology, and Metrics 

### Technique  

**<ins>*General Approach*</ins>** 
- Apple leaves reveal various disease states such as "powdery mildew", and "apple scab".
- Train various classifier models on pre-labeled images of diseased apple leaves.
- Use trained model to classify disease-state in leaf images obtained by drones or vehicles surveying orchards.
   
**<ins>*KNN Classifier Model*</ins>**  
- Since one apple/apple leaf can have multiple disease-states associated, multi-label classification strategies were used such as the following:
  - Labeled Power Set
  - Classifier Chains
  - Binary Relevance


**<ins>*Logistic Regression Model*</ins>**  
- Since one apple/apple leaf can have multiple disease-states associated, multi-label classification strategies were used such as the following:
  - Labeled Power Set
  - Classifier Chains
  - Binary Relevance
  - One Versus Rest

**<ins>*CNN Model*</ins>** 
- Various architecture,initializer combinations were used.
- The best performing combination is underlined as shown below.

### Technology
- Models used
  - KNN
  - Logistic Regression
  - CNN
- Python
- Keras
- TensorFlow
- Jupyter Notebook
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

### Metrics
- F1 Score
- Precision
- Recall

- AUC
  
## Results Overview

- Of all the models, the CNN model performed best with metrics as shown below. At the time of the experiment, our accuracy rate of 90%+ was highly competitive as compared to the [Plant Pathology 2021 - FGVC8 Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/plant-pathology-2021-fgvc8/leaderboard) posted on kaggle.
