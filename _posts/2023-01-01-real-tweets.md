## Purpose
- Twitter has become a prominent source of real-time content, yet lacks the ability to perform Tweet analytics beyond the limited web user interface.
- Create a data pipeline to gather tweets based on customizable filtering rules and criteria.
- For the purpose of this project, the focus was to gather insights on tweets related to climate change.
-  Climate change is a very important topic in today's politics, both in the US and around the world. It is potentially the biggest existential challenge that humans have ever faced. In addition, it is also a controversial topic, with ideas for addressing it ranging from fundamental tranformation of world economies to completely ignoring it. Hence, understanding what people are saying about climate change could be of interest to political parties, environmental groups and corporations.
- The analysis of the twitter data in this project seeks to answer the following questions related to climate change:
  - What are the most frequently used words in the entire set of tweets?
  - What are the frequently used words in the top 100 most retweeted tweets?
  - What are the top 5 most active usernames?
  - What are the top 5 most trending hastags?
  - What are the top 10 most retweeted tweets?
  - What fraction of retweets, likes and replies are from tweets with a URL in them, compared to tweets without a URL?
  - What fraction of retweets, likes and replies are from tweets with a hashtag, compared to tweets without a hashtag?
  - What percentage of tweets contain the hastags happeningnow or happening?
